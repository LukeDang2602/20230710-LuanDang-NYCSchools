# 20230710-LuanDang-NYCSchools

This project is a Kotlin-based implementation of an NYC Schools app that fetches school data from the New York City API and displays detailed information about each school.

The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, ensuring separation of concerns and maintainability. Retrofit 2 is utilized for network communication, enabling efficient data retrieval from the API. Asynchronous programming is handled using Flow, which provides a seamless and reactive approach to handling data streams.

In addition, the project leverages clean architecture principles and incorporates Dependency Injection using LiveData and Dagger Hilt. LiveData facilitates data observation and reactive updates, while Dagger Hilt simplifies dependency management, enhancing modularity and testability.

To ensure an intuitive user experience, the app employs Jetpack Compose and Material Design for a visually appealing and user-friendly UI. Great emphasis is placed on code readability, with meaningful variable and method names that enhance comprehensibility and maintainability."
